This project involves analyzing Vrinda Store's annual sales and customer data to uncover trends, insights, and actionable recommendations that can drive better business decisions.

## Business Problem
Vrinda Store faced challenges in understanding its performance across various categories, regions, and customer demographics. The lack of detailed insights into sales trends, channel performance, and customer preferences hindered its ability to make data-driven decisions to improve revenue and optimize operations.

   - Performance across sales channels (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra).
   - Sales distribution by regions and states.
   - Customer segmentation by age group and gender.
3. **Key Visualizations**: Built dynamic charts and graphs, including:
   - Sales by top 5 states.
   - Gender and age group breakdown of orders.
   - Order status distribution (e.g., delivered, returned, refunded).

## Key Insights
- Women contributed to 64% of total sales, with a significant share in specific categories like sarees and kurtas.
- Maharashtra was the top-performing state, contributing 34.59% of the total sales.
- Amazon emerged as the leading sales channel, accounting for 35.5% of orders, followed by Myntra and Flipkart.
- Seasonal trends were evident, with a peak in orders and sales during certain months.

## Business Impact
